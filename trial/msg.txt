Respected sir,

                Myself Liju Thomas final year B.Tech student of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University.My final year exams were about to be conducted on 11th may to 21st may. Due to COVID19 pandemic the exams rescheduled to 1st July to 8th July. M TGC entry SSB is also scheduled on 6th of July and on the same day I have my final year exams.This is not only my problem but the problem of the entire aspirants from Kerala .In Kerala more than 100 colleges are under APJ Abdul Kalam University.Kindly postpone the SSB date so that students from Kerala will also be convenient. Our final year exam timetable is attaching with this and please take necessary action so as the students from kerala can also attend.
